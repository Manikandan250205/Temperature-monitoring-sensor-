Temperature Sensor Monitoring refers to the process of continuously tracking and recording temperature data using temperature sensors. These sensors measure ambient or specific surface temperatures and send real-time data to a monitoring system for analysis, display, and alerts.Temperature sensors function by detecting heat levels in an environment and converting them into readable electronic signals. These signals are then transmitted to a monitoring system, which can be a standalone display, an industrial control unit, or a cloud-based platform. Advanced systems integrate data logging, analytics, and automated alerts to provide real-time updates and historical insights.
